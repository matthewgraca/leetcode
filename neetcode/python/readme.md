# commands and stuff
## run unit tests:
```bash
python3 -m unittest -v \path\to\your\test\file\:3
```
## patterns
### arrays and hashing
- If you do a TON of comparing and searching, hashing should be your first thought

### two pointers
- Whenever you think that you need to do a scan of an array that is n^2, think if you can do it in n time with two pointers.
